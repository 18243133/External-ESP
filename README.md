# External-ESP

Does that^

I removed the classes for weapons, vehicles, sig scanning, 
and the RegHookEx stuff for aimbots.  I intentionally left the 
aimbot math (all of it), and have clear documentation on how 
to use RegHookEx externally to write viewangles.

Uses some no-thrills menu class I wrote, feel free to make it 
pretty.

Don't sell it pls.
